Overview
********

The TQMa117xL based on the i.MX RT1170 a Cortex M7 with up to 1GHz supports
with many features and with up to 2 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces in the
implementation of applications where an energy efficient but still powerful
system should be used.

The default configuration is at
``boards/tq-systems/mba117xl/mba117xl_cm7_defconfig``.

System Clock
============

The SoC uses SysTick as the Zephyr system clock and runs at **996 MHz**.

Serial Port
===========

The i.MX RT1170 has twelve LPUARTs; Zephyr maps the console to ``LPUART1``.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build and flash applications as usual; see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run`.

Configuring a Debug Probe
=========================

Using J-Link
------------

J-Link is the default *west* runner.  Install
:ref:`jlink-debug-host-tools` and ensure they are in your *PATH*.

Either update the on-board debug circuit with Segger J-Link firmware or attach
an external :ref:`jlink-external-debug-probe`.

Ensure the FLEXSPI1 pin-mux is correct before debugging or flashing.

Typical device string for J-Link GDB:

.. code-block:: json

   "-device",
   "MIMXRT1176xxxA_M7?BankAddr=0x30000000&Loader=nCS@AD18_CLK@AD19_D0@AD20_D1@"
   "AD21_D2@AD22_D3@AD23&BankAddr=0x60000000&Loader="
   "nCS@SDB100_CLK@SDB101_D0@SDB102_D1@SDB103_D2@SDB104_D3@SDB105"

.. attention::

   Program the correct :ref:`setting-fuses` **before the first boot**.

Console Setup
=============

* 115200 baud
* 8 data bits
* No parity
* 1 stop bit
* No flow control

Select the COM port for the desired core.

Setting Fuses
=============

Set the fuses before the first boot.

- **S3:** OFF OFF OFF OFF
- **S4:** OFF OFF OFF OFF
- **S5:** OFF OFF OFF OFF
- **S6:** **ON** OFF ON ON

1. Power off the board and set the DIP switches as above.
2. Connect **UART1** to the host PC.
3. Open *Secure Provisioning Tool* and choose **MIMXRT1176**.
4. Select **UART**, the correct COM port, and 115200 baud.
5. Press *Test Connection*.
6. Open **Build image → OTP Configuration** and read the fuses.
7. Select **fuse 0x9A0** and set bit 10 (value **0x400**).
8. Verify, switch to *Advanced mode*, press *Burn*, and confirm.

.. warning::

   A wrong value in *fuse 0x9A0* will permanently brick the board.

Flashing
========

Example for :zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world`:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: mba117xl/cm7
   :goals: flash

Set **SW6 = 0 1 1 1**, power on, open a serial terminal and flash.
You should see the following output:

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS v3.4.0-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx *****
   Hello World! mimxrt1170_evk

Debugging
=========

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: mba117xl/cm7
   :goals: debug

Step through with the debugger and observe the same console output.

ENET1G Driver
=============

Current default of ethernet driver is to use 100M Ethernet instance ENET1G.
To use the 1G Ethernet instance ENET1G, include the overlay to west build with
the option ``-DEXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE=nxp,enet1g.overlay`` instead.
